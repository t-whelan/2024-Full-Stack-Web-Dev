    <h2>Promise In Javscript</h2>

<p>Promises Defenition are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way, avoiding callback hell.
    State:
    
    <li>Pending: This is the initial state of a promise. It represents that the asynchronous operation associated with the promise hasn't completed yet.</li>
    
    <li>Fulfilled: A promise is fulfilled when the asynchronous operation has been completed successfully. At this stage, the promise returns a value or result.</li>
    
    <li>Rejected: If the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails for some reason, the promise is rejected. This indicates that the promised action could not be fulfilled.</li> A reason or error object may be passed along with the rejection to provide information about the cause of the failure.
    
    <li>These states define the lifecycle of a promise, providing a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and manageable manner in JavaScript.
    
    Creating a Promise: Promises are created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function as an argument. This function, called the executor, accepts two parameters: resolve and reject.</li>
